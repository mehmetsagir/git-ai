# git-ai

AI-powered git commit tool that analyzes your changes, groups them logically, and creates meaningful commits following the Conventional Commits standard.

## Features

- **Smart Commit Grouping** - AI analyzes your changes and groups related files together by feature or purpose
- **Conventional Commits** - Automatically generates commit messages in standard format (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, etc.)
- **Stash Viewer** - Browse and manage git stashes in a beautiful web UI with diff viewer
- **Safe Workflow** - Always shows a commit plan for your approval before making any changes

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @mehmetsagir/git-ai
```

## Setup

Before using git-ai, you need to configure your OpenAI API key:

```bash
git-ai setup
```

You'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key. Get one from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## Commands

### `git-ai commit`

Analyze all changes in your repository and create intelligent commits.

```bash
git-ai commit
```

**What it does:**
1. Scans all changes (staged, unstaged, and untracked files)
2. Sends diff to AI for analysis
3. Groups related files together
4. Generates commit messages for each group
5. Shows you the commit plan for approval
6. Creates commits after your confirmation

2. Make your changes and test them locally

3. Build and verify there are no TypeScript errors
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Commit your changes using conventional commits format
